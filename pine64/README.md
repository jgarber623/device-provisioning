## Provisioning Pine64

### Flash SD Card

Download the latest Debian minimal release from [ayufanâ€™s linux-build repository](https://github.com/ayufan-pine64/linux-build) and flash the image to an SD Card using Etcher. Insert the SD Card into the Pine64, connect an Ethernet cable, and power things up!

### Configure SSH

You should now be able to SSH into the Pine64:

```sh
ssh pine64@<ip-address>
```

Copy the appropriate public key over to the Pine64:

```sh
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_pine64.pub pine64@<ip-address>
```

Double check that you can SSH to the Pine64 without requiring a password.

### Upgrade to Debian 10 (Buster)

SSH to the Pine64 and prepare for the upgrade by doing:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install locales tmux

sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

Edit `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

```text
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib non-free

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-updates main contrib non-free

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main contrib non-free

deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security/ buster/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security/ buster/updates main contrib non-free
```

Start a tmux session (with `tmux`) and run the following commands to upgrade Debian:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

Restart the Pine64 with `sudo shutdown -r now`.

After the restart, make sure everything's starting up properly. You might also want to run `sudo apt autoremove` to clean up outdated packages.

### Provision with Ansible

Before running the Ansible playbooks, SSH to the Pine64 and install Python:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python
```

Run the main Ansible playbook to provision the Pine64:

```sh
ansible-playbook -K -v playbook.yml # or run individual playbooks
```

## Bonus Knowledge

### Working with Bluetooth

The [first message in this Pine64 forum thread](https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=2248&pid=21412) contains a helpful rundown of working with Bluetooth on the Pine64.

```sh
# Make sure nothing is blocked
sudo rfkill list

# Launch bluetoothctl
sudo bluetoothctl

[bluetooth] power on
[bluetooth] agent on
[bluetooth] default-agent
[bluetooth] scan on
```

You should now see a list of devices with their device addresses. To pair with a particular device, run:

```sh
[bluetooth] pair <bluetooth-device-address>
```

### Installing and Configuring Pi-hole

[Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole)'s interactive installer doesn't play nicely with Ansible, so these steps are probably best done manually. After connecting to the Pine64, run the following to begin installation:

```sh
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

You may consider adding [hoshsadiq's addblock-nocoin-list](https://github.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list) to Pi-hole's default set of blocklists.

```sh
# Append the NoCoin Filter List to Pi-hole's adlists file
sudo tee -a /etc/pihole/adlists.list > /dev/null <<EOT
##NoCoin Filter List
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/nocoin.txt
EOT

# Update gravity
pihole -g
```

Change the temperature to Fahrenheit:

```sh
pihole -a -f
```

Swap your router's DNS configuration to point to the Pine64's IP address (v4 and v6 if you want) and you should be all set!
