# Device Provisioning

This repository contains a series of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) playbooks for provisioning some of the small single-board computers I have around the house.

## Devices

There's a `README.md` file in each device's folder with a detailed explanation of how to install and upgrade an operating system, configure the device, and install software.
